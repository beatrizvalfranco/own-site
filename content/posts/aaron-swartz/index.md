It's not always easy to find a person that really inspires us. I'm not referring myself about people that make you feel good or excited to do something. By deep inspiration, what I mean is people that live their lives so truly that it makes you question which is the path that you are following. It's a big kuhnian change of paradigms and you turn to rethink your whole life, what are your real preferences, what moves you on.

The story of Aaron Swartz, just as the story of Edward Snowden, is profoundly life changing because makes you rethink about justice, what is justice in this world and how this prognostic is messy. Because justice is about courage above all the rest.

Aaron Swartz broke with all the expectations that this world would define as success. He did it because he dedicated his journey in this life to do what he believed was fair. And justice is not about success. They are not even close. His comprehension over the internet's potential in spreading knowledge was so much ahead, specially considering he was a boy when he first started to defend the free flow of knowledge through the free gates of internet.

The Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto, written when he was just 21, nailed his belief in empowering through open knowledge. Quoting Swartz, information is power and sharing isn't immoral — it's a moral imperative. This is the core tenet of creative commons, since ideas are not rival resources.

Sergio Amadeu, a Professor at Federal University of ABC, defends that Peer-to-Peer cannot exist — and won't — if sharing is criminalized ([1](https://www.amazon.com.br/Al%C3%A9m-das-redes-colabora%C3%A7%C3%A3o-diversidade-ebook/dp/B00UCCNL52)). Being against sharing is a form of concentrating richness and power. But the belief in the possibilites for expanding creativity encouraged initiatives like BitTorrent and Wikipedia. Knowledge multiply itself insofar as it is shared.

Just as Wikimania — the Wikimedia conference in which Swartz met the Wikipedia community — was a gust of fresh air to the Internet's Own Boy that knocked him off his feet, watching his documentary ([2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m1ajvcnSuc)) and reading his book ([3](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Who-Could-Change-World/dp/162097066X)) — which I'm doing right in this moment — was for me an amazing epiphany. Swartz's history and trueness inspired me to create this blog and I hope I can join his ideas in amazing projects in the future.
